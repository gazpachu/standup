The Standup app aims at solving some of the challenges of running Scrum standup sessions remotely. At the same time, it helps to make the experience more interactive and fun!

The app uses a technology called WebRTC to reproduce a videoconference interface similar to Google Hangouts. In the back-end, a service provider called Xirsys, and a signalling server called SignalMaster help to overcome common network hickups like NATs, Firewalls and VPNs.

The app is currently under development but we hope to arrive to a point where it could be used in production mode. Stay tuned!
