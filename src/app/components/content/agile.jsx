      <h3>What is Agile Software Development?</h3>
      <p>Agile software development describes a set of values and principles for software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing cross-functional teams. It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change. These principles support the definition and continuing evolution of many software development methods.</p>
      <p>The term agile (sometimes written Agile) was popularized by the Manifesto for agile software development, which defines those values and principles. Agile software development frameworks continue to evolve, two of the most widely used being Scrum and Kanban.</p>

      <h3>What is Scrum?</h3>
      <p>Scrum is a framework for managing work with an emphasis on software development. It is designed for teams of three to nine developers who break their work into actions that can be completed within timeboxed iterations, called sprints (typically two-weeks) and track progress and re-plan in 15-minute stand-up meetings, called daily scrums. Approaches to coordinating the work of multiple scrum teams in larger organizations include Large-Scale Scrum, Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) and Scrum of Scrums, among others.</p>
